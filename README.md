[Prior reports from Israel](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/) indicated that two shots of the Pfizer vaccine were 64% effective at preventing infection, but that number may have fallen further if the [data posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MatanHolzer/status/1413202799102414851?s=09) is correct.

The [Israeli Prime Minister has commented](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/for-first-time-since-march-855-new-coronavirus-cases-in-israel-674084) that the protection offered by the vaccine is significantly lower and the data [linked to here](https://trialsitenews.com/covid-19-case-data-in-israel-a-troubling-trend/?s=09) also appear to point to far less protection.

## What are syncytia and why are they important? (16 July 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

A syncytium (pronounced sin-sish-um) is formed when at least two cells with a single nucleus fuse to form a cell with multiple nucleii. There are a number of viruses that can have this effect. SARS-Cov2 is one of them, and it is the spike protein of this virus which catalyses the formation of syncytia.

Syncytia are found more frequently in those with severe covid and there is evidence that they have a causal role in pathogenicity of the disease. They are able to evade antibodies and to fuse with and kill white blood cells invovled in the immune response, meaning that they can both evade and deplete the immune system.

Research has found that more recent variants have an enhanced ability to form larger syncytia, with the Delta variant having the highest ability. Other research has found that niclosamide appears to inhibit the formation of syncytia by blocking fusion of the infected and uninfected cells.

## Long covid has more than 200 symptoms and is more common than one would expect following asymptomatic infection (16 July 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

[A study published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext) in _The Lancet_ yesterday found that long covid can present with over 200 different symptoms making it very hard to identify. There is a good _Guardian_ [article summarising the findings](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/15/long-covid-has-more-than-200-symptoms-study-finds).

One of the authors is quoted as saying "There are likely to be tens of thousands of long Covid patients suffering in silence, unsure that their symptoms are connected to Covid-19." This is an important point because the wide and diverse range of symptoms, coupled with the high proportion of long covid in those who had asymptomatic infections (see below), means that many people who have health issues that either arose or were exacerbated recently will not be aware of the link to covid. This makes it less likely that they will receive the right medical care, and also means that it may take a considerable period ot time for the true burden of covid-19 to become apparent.

[Another report published](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media2.fairhealth.org/whitepaper/asset/A%20Detailed%20Study%20of%20Patients%20with%20Long-Haul%20COVID--An%20Analysis%20of%20Private%20Healthcare%20Claims--A%20FAIR%20Health%20White%20Paper.pdf) this week found that 27% of those with symptomatic infections had post-covid conditions and, importantly, that 19% of those who had asymptomatic infections suffered from post-covid conditions. This confirms prior findings that long covid conditions affect large numbers, but the proportion of those who had asymptomatic covid is particularly noteworthy.

## The UK strategy is changing and cases are likely increase significantly (8 July 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

After Sajid Javid became the UK Health Secretary on 26 June 2021 the message about the pace of removing restrictions changed. On his first day in the new post Javid commented that he wanted to get the UK back to normal as soon as possible, meaning easing restrictions. He followed this up a week later with an [article in the Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9753313/SAJID-JAVID-health-arguments-opening-Britain-compelling.html) (bolding added):

> We are on track for July 19 and we have to be honest with people about the fact that **we cannot eliminate Covid**.

> We also need to be clear that **cases are going to rise significantly**. I know many people will be cautious about the easing of restrictions – that’s completely understandable. But no date we choose will ever come without risk, so we have to take a broad and balanced view. We are going to have to learn to **accept the existence of Covid and find ways to cope with it – just as we already do with flu**.

This marks a [return to the policy of herd immunity](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9762445/Herd-immunity-strategy-back.html), now being called "hybrid immunity" in an effort to avoid negative connotiatons. On Monday 5 July Whitty, the UK's Chief Medical Officer, [explained the reasoning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/05/chris-whitty-keeping-covid-restrictions-will-only-delay-wave). The change from 2020 is that vaccines reduce both the death rate and hospitalisations, but other than that the message is almost identical to that presented in mid-March 2020:

> “At a certain point, you move to the situation where instead of actually averting hospitalisations and deaths, you move over to just delaying them. So you’re not actually changing the number of people who will go to hospital or die, you may change when they happen,” he said.

> “There is quite a strong view by many people, including myself actually, that going in the summer has some advantages, all other things being equal, to opening up into the autumn when schools are going back and when we’re heading into the winter period when the NHS tends to be under greatest pressure for many other reasons”

Whitty is presenting a false dichotomy: open fully now vs open fully in the autumn. That does not capture the range of possible strategies and has been chosen to justify the approach being taken. What circumstances would need to be true for this strategy to have some success? If the virus does not mutate (or does not mutate meaningfully) and there are no long-term health consequences, then this may be an effective approach.

Taking those issues in turn, there clearly are long-term health consequences from covid. Ironically, Whitty himself [spoke about the problem this week](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/chris-whitty-long-covid-young-people-children/) and highlighted the risk of long covid in younger people:

> I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages.... long Covid remains, I think, a worry. We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial.

We already know about patterns of mutation, and it remains the case that allowing the virus to transmit increases the probability of variants. The Guardian ran the following headline this week: ["Surging Covid and unlocking: does England risk being a variant factory?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/05/will-uk-rising-covid-cases-increase-risk-of-vaccine-evasive-variants). This is a very real risk.

The extent of these risks will be affected by the number of infections. And one might reasonably ask: if so many people are vaccinated, then how bad can it be? Well, here is an annecdotal data point: the British rugby team has just travelled to South Africa to tour this summer - they had a training camp in Jersey in June and all the [players were vaccinated with the Pfizer shot](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/british-irish-lions-players-given-coronavirus-jabs-before-tour) while on the island. Yesterday 9 of 38 players were in isolation after PCR tests. This is because the vaccine is not 95% effective against infections, but closer to 60-65%. The consequence of this is that case numbers in the UK could end up being very high.

**Time to prepare**

## Main symptoms have changed - covid more likely to present as a cold than a cough (13 June 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

[As per Tim Spector](https://youtu.be/OHBua3aXQ7c?t=341) at KCL who runs the [Zoe app](https://covid.joinzoe.com/). The mainstream press hasn't picked up on this and the government hasn't changed thei messaging? Why? Because they aren't adaptive, and published research is backward-looking, not real-time. 

**What does this mean?** It means people are less likely to stay at home as they won't recognise the symptoms. After all, we were told that a runny nose was a counter-indicator of covid early on. It isn't. 

**What are the most common symptoms now?**
1. Headache
2. Sore throat
3. Runny nose
4. Fever
5. Cough

Loss of smell not in the top 10 any more.

**What should you do?** Stay at home and test if you have those symptoms, and stay away from people who have those symptoms.

## It's surprising just how much more infectious Delta (Indian) variant is (13 June 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

In the video linked to above, Spector says that estiamtes of the R nought for the Delta variant, if there were no restrictions in place, are approx 6. John Campbell says other estiamtes are as high as 8. To put this in perspective, the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 had an estimated R nought of 3, meaning the Delta strain is at least twice as transmissable.

**What does this mean?**
1. **Herd immunity is unachievable.** Herd immunity threshold is 1-1/R(0), which in the initial case of R=3 was approx 67%, but is now approx 83%. With children not bieng vaccinated and vaccine effectiveness of approx 60% for Astrazeneca/Oxford, the 83% threshold is well out of reach.
1. **New variant is much more infectious.** Actual r nought in London is estimated at 1.8, so is well below the 6-8 estimate above, but the variant is clearly much more infectious even as seasonality is in our favour.

## It's still not about the death rate (13 June 2021)
<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>
<br>

It never was about the death rate, but this is a key point now that vaccination is, clearly, effective in reducing the death rate. **So what is it about? Long covid.** The number of people experiencing long term symptoms is surprising - roughly speaking 4-5 million people caught covid in the first wave, of whom approx. 1 million had sypmptoms beyond 4 weeks, and of those people approx 38% still hd symptoms 1 year later. **That is approx. 8% of those who caught the less virulent strain of covid in the first wave were still affected 1 year later.**
